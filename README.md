# Getting Started with this project

This guide will walk you through the steps required to install a ReactJS application on your local machine. ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. Node.js (version 14 or above) - You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and set up your ReactJS application:

1. Clone the repository: Begin by cloning the repository of the ReactJS application you want to install. You can use Git to clone the repository, or you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it to a local directory.

2. Navigate to the project directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the cloned ReactJS application.

3. Install dependencies: In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager): `npm install`

4. Start the development server: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command: `npm start`

5. Access the application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the appropriate URL if specified differently). You should now see the ReactJS application running successfully.
